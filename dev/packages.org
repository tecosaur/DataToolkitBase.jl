#+title: Using Packages

It is entirely likely that in the course of writing a package providing a custom
data transformer, one would come across packages that /may/ be needed.

Every possibly desired package could be shoved into the list of dependences, but
this is a somewhat crude approach. A more granular approach is enabled with two
macros, ~@addpkg~ and ~@use~.
