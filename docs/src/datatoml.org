#+title: Data.toml

A collection of data sets may be encapsulated in a =Data.toml= file, the structure
of which is described here.

* Overall structure

#+begin_src toml
data_config_version=1

name="data collection name"
uuid="a UUIDv4"
plugins=["plugin1", "plugin2", ...]

[data]
# [Properties of the data collection itself]

[[mydataset]]
uuid="a UUIDv4"
# other properties...

[[mydataset.TRANSFORMER]]
driver="transformer driver"
supports=["a QualifiedType", ...]
priority=1 # (optional)
# other properties...

[[mydataset]]
# There may be multiple data sets by the same name,
# but they must be uniquely identifyable by their properties

[[exampledata]]
# Another data set
#+end_src

* Attributes of the data collection

There are four top-level non-[[https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#table][table]] properties currently recognised.

+ =data_config_version= :: The (integer) version of the format. Currently =1=.
+ =name= :: an identifying string. Cannot contain =:=, and characters outside of
  =[A-Za-z0-9_]= are recommended against.
+ uuid :: a UUIDv4 used to uniquely refer to the data collection, should it be
  renamed etc.
+ plugins :: a list of plugins which should be used when working with this data collection

In addition to these four, a special table of the name =data= is recognised. This
holds custom attributes of the data collection, e.g.

#+begin_src toml
[data]
mykey="value"

[data.defaults]
description="Ooops, somebody forgot to describe this."

[data.defaults.storage.filesystem]
priority=2
#+end_src

Note that as a consequence of this special table, no data set may be named "data".

* Structure of a data set

#+begin_src toml
[[mydataset]]
uuid="a UUIDv4"
# other properties...

[[mydataset.TRANSFORMER]]
driver="transformer driver"
supports=["a QualifiedType", ...]
priority=1 # (optional)
# other properties...
#+end_src

A data set is a top-level instance of an [[https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables][array of tables]], with any name other
than =data=. Data set names need not be unique, but should be able to be uniquely
identified by the combination of their name and parameters.

Apart from data transformers, there is one recognised data property: =uuid=, a
UUIDv4 string. Any number of additional properties may be given (so long as they
do not conflict with the transformer names), they may have special behaviour
based on plugins or extensions loaded, but will not be treated specially by
DataToolkitBase.

A data set can have any number of data transformers, but at least two are needed
for a functional data set. Data transformers are instances of an array of tables
(like data sets), but directly under the data set table.

* Structure of a data transformer

There are three data transformers types, with the following names:
+ =storage=
+ =loader=
+ =writer=

All transformers recognise three properties:
+ =driver=, the transformer driver name, as a string
+ =supports=, an array of ~QualifiedType~ strings
+ =priority=, an integer which sets the order in which multiple transformers
  should be considered

The =driver= and =supports= properties are mandatory. =priority= can be omitted, in
which case it will adopt the default value (~1~).
